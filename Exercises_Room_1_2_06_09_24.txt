room one 
	new dwnld file url changeable witch params. 
	count Gs and Cs
	create Report as .md file 
	make it pretty ifos included, 
		how many sequences
		how many C/Gs
		(sed -e replaces '/whatToReplace/withwhat/g(g- whole line)'
		
room two
	create tool between organisms base on dinucleotides number (16 possible ones) 
	foreach dinucl plot how many there are classification reference????
	needs lagre evolutionary distance more accurate with oliginucleotides
	possible 2 loops but here 
	pipeline dwnld genome by changeable URL (PARAMS.URL) 
	CALCULATE FREQUENCE OF DINUCLEOTIDES	
	create config file wheere line by line all are listed GG AA ac ...
	this file should be second input for pipeline an  then count how often the pattern 
	(each line by it self Split?) ouccures
	r scroipt that reads input and plots x-achse dinuc y frequence
	the execute with two diff genomes and a short seq 
	the make statement to wich genopme the short one belongs
	
	methodes 
	channel.fromPath instead of download if file on SSD
	channel.split text creates chunks of values in Chanell in steadf ofg files
	channel.combine one channel for file one channel for dinucleotides create anrray 
		channel with a line from dinuc file and the file so it searches for each file
	channel.map defines operation that will be perforemd on each element but not in bash but with groovy
