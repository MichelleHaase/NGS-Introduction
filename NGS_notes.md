# Next gen sequencing
 * 1. Gen senger etc
 * 2. Gen much longer reads up to ~1 Billion
 * 3. Gen single-molecule sequencing

## 1st Gen
PCR - (Polymerase Chain reaction) replicates sequences according to 
primer, needs DNA(template), primer, reverse primer, oligopetides 
(buildingblocks), polymerase.

* the doublestrand is separated with Temperature, since primers bind
      faster that the whole strand(because of size) lowering the Tempbackdown lets primer bind and polymerase work repeating this process gives a amount of DNA copies with exponential replication rate.
    
* realtime PCR - needs probe that has a reporter and a quencher that give 
  a light feed back if destroyed, it binds inbetween the primer and
  reverse primer and gets destroyed by the Polymerase the reporter part
  then no longer quenched gives back a certain wavelength if activated
  (light) cT-val. - indicator for the amount of DNA was included, the higher the Value the lower the DNA input since it took longer to get to a detectable level of emitted light.
